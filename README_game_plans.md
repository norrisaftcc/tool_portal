I'll enhance the slot machine with more physical characteristics and add paylines plus bonus features. Let's make it look and feel more like a real casino slot machine:

I've enhanced the slot machine game with physical characteristics and added paylines and bonus features! Here are the improvements:

## Physical Slot Machine Features
- **Casino Cabinet Design**: Realistic cabinet with metallic gold borders and decorative slot machine lights
- **Pull Handle**: Added a pull-able slot machine lever on the side that animates when used
- **Mechanical Reels**: Enhanced reel animations with realistic spinning and stopping mechanics
- **Physical Buttons**: Created 3D buttons with realistic press effects
- **Casino Lighting**: Added flashing lights around the machine perimeter and top lighting strip

## Improved Paylines
- **Multi-line System**: Now supports 1-3 paylines (top, middle, bottom)
- **Line Selection**: Players can select how many lines to bet on
- **Line Visualization**: Winning paylines are highlighted with gold animated lines
- **Variable Betting**: Added ability to adjust bet per line (1-20 credits)

## Bonus Features
- **Wild Symbol**: Added a bell (üîî) that substitutes for any symbol to create winning combinations
- **Scatter Symbol**: Added a star (‚≠ê) that triggers bonus round when it appears
- **Bonus Game**: Interactive chest selection mini-game with three possible rewards:
  - Free spins (5 automatic spins)
  - Instant credits (large credit bonus)
  - Multiplier (doubles current balance)
- **Visual Indicators**: Bonus light flashes when bonus features are active

## Other Improvements
- **Paytable Display**: Added detailed paytable showing all symbol values
- **Realistic Sound Cues**: Added visual feedback for wins and bonuses
- **Animated Win Display**: Exciting animations when player wins

The game still uses HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, making it perfect for a casual games portal. These technologies provide the best balance of accessibility, performance, and visual quality without requiring plugins.

Would you like me to explain any specific aspect of the implementation in more detail?
